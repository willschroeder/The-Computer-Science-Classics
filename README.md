# The Computer Science Classics

This is a collection of Algorithms, Puzzles, Design Patterns, Problems, and anything else that is essential enough to be deemed 'The Cannon' of computer science.

These are written in Swift 3, made in Xcode playgrounds. I chose Swift because I love the language, and I think it’s exceedingly clear to read. I don’t use most of the capabilities of Swift in order to document the concept as clearly and language agnostically possible.

Many things here are largely based around the very cool Swift Algorithm Club repo on GitHub.
